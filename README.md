# Geoguessr-AI
Geoguessr is a game where you are given a random location in Google Streetview, then tasked with determining where you are using only what you can see around you. The game can be deceptively difficult, so I decided to see if I could use my knowledge of machine learning to make an AI that could solve this tricky problem.
